This is a Gnome Shell Extension that enables Gnome top bar to show up while
you're playing full screen content. Just hover the mouse cursor to the top of
the screen, and the top bar will show up. Take the cursor away, and it will
disappear.

This is similar to what macOS offers for full screen apps.

# <img width="32px" src="./img/icon-128.webp" alt="project icon" /> Panel On Fullscreen (Gnome Extension)

This is a Gnome Shell Extension that enables Gnome top panel to show up while
full screen content is on the screen. Just hover your mouse cursor to the top of
the screen, and the panel will show up.

The behaviour is similar to what you can find on macOS.

Work in Progress!
